              I am not here to sell you a trendy layout and hope for the best. I look at your website like a business tool.
              If you do not have one yet, the job is to get you online fast with something credible and usable. If you already have one, the job is to fix what is blocking trust and leads.

              My approach is blunt on purpose: clarify the offer, tighten the structure, improve the user path, and make it easier for the right people to call, book, request a quote, or send an inquiry.
